Instructions for play:
Each player receives four ships that they must place on a 10 x 10 board. After successful placement, the players will then alternate guessing coordinates that contain a ship. For each guess that has a ship present, a hit is added. Once all ships are hit, the player that hit the most wins.
For each ship, input the coordinate you wish to place one end at as well as the direction you'd like it to be in. 
The format is [X-Coordinate] [Y-Coordinate] [Direction], ex 3 6 2
Valid coordinates are the integers 1-10
The directions are as follows: 0 = Up, 1 = Down, 2 = Left, 3 = Right
